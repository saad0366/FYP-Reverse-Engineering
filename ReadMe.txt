This project showcases a reverse-engineered Java application for managing Final Year Projects (FYPs) in a university setting. It demonstrates how object-oriented principles like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity are used in practice. The system is designed using the MVC architecture and analyzed with GRASP principles and Design Patterns.

It includes:

User management: create, update, delete, and search users by role or name.

Report generation system.

Clean Java classes (User, Report, UserController) with clear responsibilities.
